DP
1. What is Dynamic Programming (DP)?
At its core, DP is just Optimized Recursion.

Imagine I ask you to write 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 on a piece of paper. You count and say "5". Now, if I add another + 1 to the left side, do you recount the first five ones? No. You just take your previous answer ("5") and add one to get "6".
That is DP. It is the principle of "Don't Repeat Yourself."In Computer Science terms, a problem needs two things to be solvable with DP:Overlapping Subproblems: The code keeps asking for the same result over and over (like fib(3) being calculated inside fib(5) and fib(4)).Optimal Substructure: You can solve the big problem (House Robber for 5 houses) by combining the answers of smaller problems (House Robber for 4 houses and 3 houses).2. Why Do Interviewers Love It?They don't ask it to torture you. They ask it to test one specific skill: Trade-offs.The Naive Engineer writes a recursive solution that takes $O(2^n)$ time (Exponential). It works for $n=10$ but crashes the server for $n=50$.The Senior Engineer (You) recognizes the repeated work. You decide to spend a little bit of Space (RAM/Memory to store the table) to save a massive amount of Time (CPU cycles).In an interview, DP signals:"This candidate knows how to optimize.""This candidate understands that memory is cheap, but time is expensive."3. Real World Examples (The "In-Depth" Part)You think you'll never use this? You use it every day.A. Google Maps (Shortest Path)Problem: Find the fastest route from your house to the gym.DP logic: To find the fastest route to the Gym, Google first calculates the fastest route to the intersection before the Gym. It reuses that data for everyone else trying to get to that intersection. It doesn't recalculate the entire road network for every single user.Algorithm: Floyd-Warshall or Bellman-Ford (Graph DP).B. Spell Check / Auto-Correct (Edit Distance)Problem: You type "Helol". Did you mean "Hello"?DP logic: The computer calculates the minimum number of edits (insert, delete, replace) to turn "Helol" into "Hello". It builds a 2D table to compare the words character by character.Algorithm: Levenshtein Distance (Day 72 of your roadmap).C. Git Diff (Version Control)Problem: You change a file. git diff shows you exactly what lines changed.DP logic: It finds the "Longest Common Subsequence" (LCS) between the old file and the new file to display the minimum changes needed.Algorithm: LCS (Day 71 of your roadmap).D. Network Routing (The Internet)Problem: Sending a data packet from India to the US.DP logic: Routers share "cost" tables with each other. They build the best path hop-by-hop based on stored data from neighbors.
