## 🎯 Core Concept: List Merging

### What is List Merging?
**Merging sorted linked lists** means combining two or more already-sorted lists into a single sorted list without losing any elements and maintaining the sorted order.

### Visual Example:
```
List 1: [1] → [2] → [4] → NULL
List 2: [1] → [3] → [4] → NULL

Result: [1] → [1] → [2] → [3] → [4] → [4] → NULL
```

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Process

### The Merge Algorithm:
```
1. Create a dummy node (simplifies edge cases)
2. Use two pointers for both lists
3. Compare current elements
4. Link smaller element to result
5. Advance pointer of selected list
6. Repeat until one list is exhausted
7. Attach remaining elements
```

### Visual Walkthrough:
```
Initial State:
List1: [1] → [2] → [4]     List2: [1] → [3] → [4]
        ↑                           ↑
       ptr1                        ptr2

Step 1: Compare 1 vs 1 → Take first 1
Result: [1] → ...
List1: [1] → [2] → [4]     List2: [1] → [3] → [4] 
              ↑                           ↑
             ptr1                        ptr2

Step 2: Compare 2 vs 1 → Take 1
Result: [1] → [1] → ...
List1: [1] → [2] → [4]     List2: [1] → [3] → [4]
              ↑                                ↑
             ptr1                             ptr2

Continue until complete...
```

## 💻 Implementation

### Basic Node Structure:
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
```

### Core Merge Function:
```python
def merge_two_lists(l1, l2):
    # Dummy node simplifies logic
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    current = dummy
    
    # Compare and merge
    while l1 and l2:
        if l1.val <= l2.val:
            current.next = l1
            l1 = l1.next
        else:
            current.next = l2
            l2 = l2.next
        current = current.next
    
    # Attach remaining elements
    current.next = l1 or l2
    
    return dummy.next  # Skip dummy
```

### Why Dummy Node?
- **Simplifies Code**: No special handling for first element
- **Cleaner Logic**: Same logic for all elements
- **Edge Case Friendly**: Works when lists are empty

## 🧩 Practice Problems

### 1. Basic Merge (LeetCode 21)
**Problem**: Merge two sorted linked lists
**Input**: `[1,2,4]` and `[1,3,4]`
**Output**: `[1,1,2,3,4,4]`

### 2. Merge K Lists (LeetCode 23) 
**Problem**: Merge k sorted linked lists
**Approaches**:
- **Pairwise**: Merge two at a time - O(nk²)
- **Divide & Conquer**: Split and merge - O(nk log k)
- **Priority Queue**: Use heap - O(nk log k)

### 3. Variations:
- Remove duplicates while merging
- Merge in descending order
- Handle null/empty lists

---

## ⚡ Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:
- **Two Lists**: O(n + m) - visit each node once
- **K Lists (naive)**: O(nk²) - inefficient pairwise
- **K Lists (optimal)**: O(nk log k) - using heap or divide-conquer

### Space Complexity:
- **In-place**: O(1) - just rearranging pointers
- **New list**: O(n + m) - if creating new nodes
- **Recursive**: O(n + m) - call stack space

## 🔧 Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### ❌ Common Mistakes:
1. **No dummy node** → Complex first element handling
2. **Forget remaining elements** → Data loss
3. **Wrong comparison** → Breaks sorting
4. **Null checks missing** → Runtime errors

### ✅ Best Practices:
1. **Always use dummy node** - cleaner code
2. **Handle nulls early** - prevent crashes  
3. **Test edge cases** - empty lists, single elements
4. **Prefer iterative** - saves stack space
