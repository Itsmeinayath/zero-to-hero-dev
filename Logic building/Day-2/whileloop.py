# while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given condition.
# The loop continues to execute as long as the condition evaluates to true.
# example 
# count  = 0
# while count < 5:
#     print("count is:",count)
#     count += 1
# print("the count is : ",count)
