Conditional Statements and logical operators

Explanation:

What are Conditionals?: Conditionals let you execute code based on whether a condition is true or false (e.g., “if it’s raining, take an umbrella”). They’re the decision-making backbone of programming.
Types:

if condition: – Runs if true (e.g., if x > 0:).
elif condition: – Else if, checks next condition if previous is false (e.g., elif x == 0:).
else: – Runs if all above are false (e.g., else:).


Logical Operators:

and: True if both conditions are true (e.g., x > 0 and x < 10).
or: True if at least one condition is true (e.g., x > 0 or x < -5).
not: Negates a condition (e.g., not x == 0).


Comparison Operators:

== (equal), != (not equal), < (less than), > (greater than), <=, >=.


Nesting: if inside if (e.g., if x > 0: if x < 5:).
Best Practices:

Avoid complex nesting—use elif to flatten.
Test edge cases (e.g., 0, negative numbers).
Use comments to explain logic.
