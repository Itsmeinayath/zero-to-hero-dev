# What is loop 
# Loops are used to repeat instruction / piece of code untill a certain condition is met 
# Loop is a programming construct that allows for repeated execution of a block of code as long as a specified condition is met.
# In Python, there are two main types of loops: for loops and while loops.

# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects.
# A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

# there is break and continue
# The break statement is used to exit the loop prematurely, regardless of the loop's condition.
# When a break statement is encountered, the loop is terminated, and control is transferred to the next statement following the loop.

# The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration.
# When a continue statement is encountered, the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration is skipped.

# while loops Syntax
# while condition:
#     # code block to be executed

# For loops Syntax
# for variable in iterable:
#     # code block to be executed
